    <h1>The coolest creature</h1>
    <p>The <em>Portuguese Man O' War</em> is awesome because <strong>It's actually comprised of, like, five to seven other animals</strong>. It's got whole animals which operate as its defence, its method of transportation, and its genatalia! Imagine if your nether regions were actually a seperat entity. I think that would be sick. I would name my little buddy Jerry, because Jerry has no mouth and cannot manage the concept of language. Jerry simply lives to fuck. Jerry's actually a pretty cool guy.</p><p>
    hypothetically.
